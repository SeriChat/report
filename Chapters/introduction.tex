\chapter{Introduction}\label{cha:introduction}
Today we have a lot of different chat systems used for different purposes. These chat systems are build for all kind of operating systems. 
Some of which are not encrypted, others are client-side encrypted and a few are end-to-end encrypted. Common for most of these chat systems are the dependency on centralized solutions which sort of can have some back doors that can create uncertainty about privacy of data. 

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) which is a decentralized way of communicating is an architecture where no one can have a superior role opposed to e.g. a client/server solution or other solutions with third-party interactions. By using P2P one gets rid of the uncertainty for others knowing about data or communication that is meant to be private. 

P2P could be a good alternative for an infrastructure used for chat systems. There already exist designs and implementations of P2P based chat systems e.g. SCRIBE. None of these solutions can catch up with today's existing popular client/server based chat systems. 

This project is intended to build a confidential and fair group chat system based on Kademlia.

%The purpose of the Introduction is make a short (2--6 pages) argument
%that should cover
%\begin{itemize}
%\item What this thesis is about
%\item Why it is interesting or important
%\item What are the central hypotheses that will be investigated 
%\item How will the work be done
%\end{itemize}
%
%This is the place where the reader (who will be a computer scientist,
%but might not be a domain expert) should be convinced that not only is
%the topic interesting and important, the authors have also identified
%central questions/hypotheses pertaining the topic, and have a clear
%plan and methodology to address it.
%
%\section{What makes a good hypothesis?}
%\label{sec:what-makes-good}
%
%For the purposes of a report or thesis, it is wise to concentrate on
%research questions and hypotheses that are quantifiable. \Eg, it is
%better to state that ``method A is better than method B under
%circumstances C'' or ``combining method A with architecture B improves
%on standard approach C'' than ``we can build a system that do X''.
%This is why it is always a good idea to include baselines in your
%work, \ie, established methods or architectural choices that can used
%for comparison. If you do not have baselines yourself, you should at
%least be ready and able to compare your results with the published
%results of others.
%
%The hypotheses should also address central aspects of the work, so
%that \emph{if} these hypotheses are met, the overall work gains in
%credibility, or alternatively (and just as valid), if the hypothesis
%\emph{cannot} be confirmed, it illustrates, why and how the
%assumptions behind the work were flawed, and, hopefully, how they can
%be improved.
%
%\section{Writing a thesis for reading}
%\label{sec:writ-thes-read}
%
%The purpose of the thesis is to be read as a whole, and as such it
%should be written, even if, in reality, it is authored over a period
%of months.  The reader does not naturally understand the flow and
%process of the work involved (this understanding belongs to the
%authors, and upon the authors lies the sole responsibility of
%communicating the work done), and must therefore be guided through the
%work.  In order to accomplish this, the reader should at
%all times have a ready answer in their mind to these questions:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Why am I reading this?
%\item What comes next?
%\item How does this build upon what I just read?
%\end{itemize}
%
%So, why is something there? What is its purpose? How will it used
%later? Vice versa, later in the text, refer back to things established
%earlier (this also supports readers that do not necessarily read
%linearly). While a text grow piecemeal, it is most often read as a
%whole, and should appear as such, lest the reader loses interest.	
%
%To that end, it is a good idea to finish the introduction with a
%description of how the hypotheses are to be investigated, and how this
%is reflected in the structure of the thesis.
