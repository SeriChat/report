\chapter{Implementation} \label{cha:implementation}
%Where the design chapter concerned itself with the overall plan, this
%is where the actual experiment in the form of an implementation is
%taking form.  It is not the purpose of the implementation to fully
%realise the design described in the previous chapter. It is the
%exclusive purpose of the implementation (a subset of the design) to
%either validate or refute the hypotheses put forth in the
%introduction. This, and nothing else. If it does less, you have posed
%questions you are not prepared to answer; if it does more, you should
%be coding less or asking more questions.
%
%If it illustrates core aspects, \eg, the inner working of a particular
%important algorithm or function, code segments are welcome in this
%chapter, as long as they are short, to the point, well-commented and
%-formatted.  It is also a good idea to provide the reader with a
%general overview of the structure of the code, as well as how
%communication between various parts take place.  The complete code (as
%well as your data) should be included separately with your report in
%the form of a zip-file or USB-stick.
%
%Overall, the implementation is the computer scientist's equivalent of
%lab equipment carefully arranged into a experimental setup, and just
%as the validity of an experimental investigation will be judged in
%part on the craftsmanship of the setup, so will the quality of your
%implementation. It is therefore important to clearly communicate how
%your system works, so that the reader may have confidence in your
%evaluation and conclusions.
%System 
This chapter describes the developed prototype of the group chat system according to described design in chapter \ref{cha:design}.
SeriChat is implemented in Java 1.8 and one of the reasons for this choice is because of TomP2P is implemented in Java. 


TomP2P ::/ 

Java -- encryption


not-implemented -- fault-tolerance
