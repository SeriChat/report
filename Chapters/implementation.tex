\chapter{Implementation} \label{cha:implementation}
%Where the design chapter concerned itself with the overall plan, this
%is where the actual experiment in the form of an implementation is
%taking form.  It is not the purpose of the implementation to fully
%realise the design described in the previous chapter. It is the
%exclusive purpose of the implementation (a subset of the design) to
%either validate or refute the hypotheses put forth in the
%introduction. This, and nothing else. If it does less, you have posed
%questions you are not prepared to answer; if it does more, you should
%be coding less or asking more questions.
%
%If it illustrates core aspects, \eg, the inner working of a particular
%important algorithm or function, code segments are welcome in this
%chapter, as long as they are short, to the point, well-commented and
%-formatted.  It is also a good idea to provide the reader with a
%general overview of the structure of the code, as well as how
%communication between various parts take place.  The complete code (as
%well as your data) should be included separately with your report in
%the form of a zip-file or USB-stick.
%
%Overall, the implementation is the computer scientist's equivalent of
%lab equipment carefully arranged into a experimental setup, and just
%as the validity of an experimental investigation will be judged in
%part on the craftsmanship of the setup, so will the quality of your
%implementation. It is therefore important to clearly communicate how
%your system works, so that the reader may have confidence in your
%evaluation and conclusions.
%System 
This chapter describes the developed prototype of the group chat system according to described design in chapter \ref{cha:design}.
SeriChat is implemented in Java 1.8 and one of the reasons for this choice is to satisfy the goal of being a cross-platform implementation. The second reason is because of TomP2P is implemented in Java. TomP2P is the most up-to-date of the existing implementations of the Kademlia infrastructure. \autoref{fig:umlSeriChat} presents the SeriChat architecture and its dependencies to the TomP2P libraries.

%Description of the different classes... %WHAT SHOULD THERE BE SOMETHING HERE???

\section{TomP2P}
The latest stable version of TomP2P on their official website is version 4.4, which was released at 20th of May, 2013. However, several beta versions has been released subsequently and the newest of them is TomP2P 5.0-Beta8 which was released the 27th of May, 2015 and it is currently still being updated on their official GitHub account.

In the beginning of this project it was decided to use the latest stable version because of the stability but also because of most of the provided documentation (which was very poor), was written for version 4.4. But after having contacted the developer of TomP2P, Thomas Bocek, he strongly recommended us to use the latest beta release due to the many new futures and the many bugs fixes which has been done since version 4.4. He also referred to his GitHub repository where he has a couple of up-to-date examples explaining how to use the latest version.

\subsection{Signing key-values}
The key-values in a DHT are in principle overwritable, this is not acceptable by SeriChat groups which is depending on the availability of the group-keys. However TomP2P has thought about this challenge and provides an entry-signing mechanism. When you put an entry you can choose to sign the entry by the public-key of the owner. By doing that, TomP2P will ensure that the signed entry only can be deleted, updated, or overwritten by the author himself. \autoref{lst:signingEntry} shows how SeriChat lets the group owner sign the group-key entry by his pubic-key that is provided by the \emph{keyPair} variable.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,frame=tblr,caption={Entry signing by the group owner},label=lst:signingEntry]
ownerPeerDHT.put(groupId).data( new Data( new GroupKey(
	ownerPeerDHT.peerAddress(), keyPair.getPublic()))
	.protectEntry(keyPair)).sign().start().awaitUninterruptibly();
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Direct communication}
SeriChat group chat system uses, as explained in \autoref{cha:design}, direct communication between the group members. This functionality is provided by the TomP2P implementation of \emph{sendDirect} method. This method accepts a \emph{PeerAddress} instance which contains the \emph{ip-address} and the \emph{port number}. \autoref{lst:sendDirectToRoot} shows how a group member contacts the root directly by using the \emph{sendDirect} method, to get the message forwarded to the other group members.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,frame=tblr,caption={Sending direct to the root},label=lst:sendDirectToRoot]
SeriEvent seriEvent = new SeriEvent(EventType.FORWARD_MESSAGE, groupName, msgBytes, nickName);
PeerAddress root = group.getRootAddress();
sendingPeerDHT.peer().sendDirect(root).object(seriEvent).start().awaitUninterruptibly();
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Implementing confidentiality}
The Java programming language provides two packages to support cryptography, \emph{java.security} package and \emph{javax.crypto} package. These two packages are used to make the SeriChat confidential. \autoref{lst:cryptoExample} is a code snippet of the \emph{join} event-handler. The received password is decrypted by an \emph{RSA} private-key. Then only if the password matches the group password, an \emph{AES} secret key is encrypted by the \emph{RSA} public-key and replied to the requester.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,frame=tblr,caption={Example of \emph{java.security} and \emph{javax.crypto} usage},label=lst:cryptoExample]
cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA");
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, keyPair.getPrivate());
String pass = new String(cipher.doFinal(event.getPassword()));
if (group.getPassword().equals(pass)) {
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, event.getPublicKey());
...
return cipher.doFinal(group.getGrpAESKey().getEncoded());
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Fault-tolerance}
The fault-tolerance design described in \autoref{cha:design} was not implemented due to the limited time schedule for this project.
