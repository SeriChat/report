\section{Overview}
\section{}

%Many of the other natural sciences have labs with equipment that has
%to be configured correctly to experimentally test stated hypotheses.
%Such experiments must be planned and designed in advance to work
%properly and provide valid and trustworthy results.
%
%As computer scientists, we usually do not work in labs, and our
%experiments do not live in petri dishes. Still, we have hypotheses to
%test, and thus, experiments to plan. This planning phase is the
%design, where the authors describe the system intended to test the
%hypotheses posed in the introduction.
%
%A luxury of the design chapter is that the design may well go further
%than solely the confirmation or refutation of the hypotheses.  If you
%are building a system, this is where you show that you know how to
%design one, even if you will actually not be implementing all of it.
%If you had sufficient time and resources, this is how you would make
%your system.
%
%However, before we come to that, it is necessary to investigate
%whether the required hypotheses are valid. If they are not, the design
%must be reconsidered, and there is only one way to test them, namely
%through implementation, and subsequent evaluation.
