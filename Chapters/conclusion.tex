\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}
In this project report, we provide a design and a proof-of-concept of a new group chat system build on top of Kademlia with special focus on confidentiality and fairness.
We present some related work, among others different P2P infrastructures and P2P-based group communication systems.

The different scenarios that are necessary for a group chat system as \emph{create}, \emph{join}, \emph{communicate}, and \emph{leave} are analysed and from these a carefully chosen design with focus on fairness is extracted. 
Fault-tolerance is an important part of our design to make the group chat system robust. The design of fault-tolerance is inspired by a research paper which presents a group chat extension for Kademlia \cite{matl2015effective}.
Confidentiality is also a very important part of our design where focus is on ensuring that third-party cannot intercept the communication.

A proof-of-concept is implemented with the majority of the designed functionalities though the part with fault-tolerance is not implemented. In the proof-of-concept it is possible to create a group, join a group, and communicate within group, but the leave functionality is not implemented, see \autoref{app:poc}. 
The most challenging part in the implementation is to setup and use the TomP2P libraries. TomP2P has some poor and outdated documentation, which makes it very difficult to explorer its functionalities.  

The results shows clearly that the SeriChat design is able to among others achieve fairness. The results also shows that SeriChat has a reasonable latency in a typical group size (between 2-25 members). 

Building a confidential group chat system based on P2P and in the same time keep the system fair as a better alternative to the existing solutions shows to be promising, all in all. However, there are still a lot to build and improve before SeriChat is a complete solution and ready for being used by millions of people.
